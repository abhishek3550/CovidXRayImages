# COVID-19 X-Ray Image Classification with Deep Learning

This project focuses on classifying X-ray images into three categories: COVID-19, Non-COVID, and Normal using deep learning techniques. The dataset used in this project contains X-ray images obtained from patients with different conditions.

## Dataset

The dataset used in this project is available at [CovidXRayImages](https://example.com/dataset). It consists of X-ray images categorized into COVID-19, Non-COVID, and Normal classes.
